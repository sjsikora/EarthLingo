# Welcome to Earthlingo

Alien vocal cords are unlike humans which means many aliens have trouble speaking Earthlanguage. So, we have made this site to help you on your path to speaking fluently! Input some sample text, or generate some random text, hit the microphone and start reading! We will then grade you on your ability to pronounce Earth phonetics.

This project was a solo endeavour for BC Hacks 5.0.


## Open Source Acklowngments

Thank you to the following open source site whose code I have used within this project:

- [AzureSpeechReactSample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSpeechReactSample) for logic with speech SDK and token handling.
- [Icesofty](https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/landing-page-with-twinkling-stars) for the amazing twinkling star effect.

Made with React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Microsoft Azure.
